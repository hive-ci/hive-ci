# The BBC Hive Project

{: .lead}
BBC Hive is an initiative within BBC Digital to make our
internal test tools and libraries available to the wider testing
community

<br />

## Why open source?

We are hugely dependent on a wide range of open source software and
technologies and value the community immensely. We have made
various projects open source over the years, and contibuted to countless
existing projects.

Software testing is a particular area where we are massively
reliant on on open source software -- and also an area where we invest
a lot of time building tools and libraries to make the testing effort
easier -- particularly when it comes to testing our products on physical
devices such as mobile phones and smart TVs.

We established the BBC Hive project as a way of sharing our device-testing
innovations and experiments as open source code and libraries -- driven
particularly by external interest in our on-device CI system: *Hive CI*
We're making everything available on github on our
[BBC](https://github.com/bbc) organisation.

The full *Hive CI* solution isn't quite ready to share yet, but we are
committed to releasing all our internal test tools over 2015.

## This website

This website serves as the documentation focus for all the projects
released under the BBC Hive banner, but also it's a place for us to share
our tacit knowledge from years of testing software and overcoming the
difficulties of on-device testing. We've learnt so much
from trying out new ideas and practices -- some were successful, some weren't
-- and our source code only informs part of the story.

<br />

## How to get involved
All *BBC Hive* projects are released under the MIT license. We'd love for
you to get involved -- whether that's through discussion or code.

If you're looking to contribute, there's more detail
